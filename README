Kitsune-enabled Tor
===================

This is a version of the Tor anonymity network patched to support
dynamic updating using Kitsune.

Building
========

To build all versions, run the 'build_tor' script in the root
directory. To build a specific version, change directory to it's
subdirectory and run either `./autogen.sh && ./configure && make` or
just `./configure && make`, depending on the version.

If Kitsune is not installed in your PATH, the environment variable
KITSUNE_PATH must refer to a valid Kitsune installation (the `bin`
directory of the core Kitsune repository will work).

Tor's build dependencies are libevent and openssl.

The build process will produce `tor`, the standard Tor binary,
`tor.so`, a shared object to be used with Kitsune, and
`tor-update.so`, a copy of `tor.so`.

Running
=======

Building Tor results in a standard Tor binary in
`tor-<version>/src/or/tor`, and a dynamically-updatable shared object
in `tor-<version>/src/or/tor.so`. To run a dynamically updatable Tor
instance, use the Kitsune driver utility:

`driver tor.so torrc`

Updating
========

To update Tor, use Kitsune's `doupd` script:

`doupd <Tor pid> <new tor version.so>`

For a dynamic update to work, the target version must have been built
with the running version specified as its previous version. All
versions of Tor are, by default, built to update from the last
available version. The `tor-update.so` file produced by the build
process in each version directory can be used to "update" any version
to itself.
